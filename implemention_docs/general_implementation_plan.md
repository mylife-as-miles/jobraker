## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the overall implementation strategy for the Jobraker application, encompassing multiple phases from the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to a feature-rich, scalable platform. This plan is derived from and aligned with the project's core documentation: `Jobraker_PRD.markdown`, `app_flow.md`, `backend_structure.md`, and `tech_stack.md`.

The goal is to provide a strategic roadmap for development, allowing for iterative progress, feedback incorporation, and planned evolution of the application.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Iterative Development:** Deliver value in stages, allowing for learning and adaptation.
*   **User-Centricity:** Prioritize features and refinements based on user needs and feedback (refer to Target Audience in PRD).
*   **Technical Excellence:** Adhere to `frontend_guidelines.md` and `tech_stack.md` for a robust and maintainable codebase.
*   **Scalability & Security:** Build with future growth and data protection in mind from the outset (NFRs in PRD, `backend_structure.md`).

## 3. Phased Implementation Overview

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Core User Journey

*   **Goal:** Launch a functional application that allows users to sign up, manage a basic profile and resume, search for jobs via Adzuna, and initiate automated applications via Skyvern. Establish the core backend infrastructure on Supabase.
*   **Key Deliverables (High-Level):
    *   **User Authentication:** Clerk integration for sign-up (email/social) and login (PRD REQ-AUTH-001 to REQ-AUTH-006).
    *   **Onboarding & Profile:** Basic user profile setup, single resume upload (PDF, DOCX) (PRD REQ-PROF-001, REQ-PROF-002).
    *   **Job Search (Adzuna):** Keyword and location-based job search, results display (PRD REQ-JOBS-001, REQ-JOBS-002).
    *   **Automated Application (Skyvern - Initial):** Initiate automated application for selected jobs using stored profile/resume (PRD REQ-APPLY-001, REQ-APPLY-002).
    *   **Application Tracking (Basic):** View history and status of applications made through Jobraker (PRD REQ-TRACK-001, REQ-TRACK-002).
    *   **Backend Foundation:** Supabase setup for `users`, `job_preferences`, `applications` tables, and resume storage (`backend_structure.md`).
*   **Primary Focus:** Validating the core value proposition and user flow.
*   **Reference:** Detailed breakdown in `phase_1_implementation_plan.md`.

### Phase 2: Enhancement, Analytics & User Feedback Incorporation

*   **Goal:** Refine existing features based on Phase 1 feedback, introduce user analytics, improve settings, and enhance the AI capabilities for resume preparation.
*   **Key Deliverables (High-Level):
    *   **AI Resume Preparation (Enhanced):** Introduce initial AI-driven suggestions for resume improvement (keywords, structure - placeholder in Phase 1, actual implementation here).
    *   **Advanced Job Search:** Implement filters, sorting (PRD REQ-JOBS-003), and saving search preferences (PRD REQ-PROF-004).
    *   **Skyvern Integration (Improved):** Better error handling, feedback mechanisms, and potentially support for more complex application forms.
    *   **Analytics Dashboard (P1):** Implement user-facing analytics on application activity (PRD REQ-ANALYTICS-001 to REQ-ANALYTICS-004).
    *   **Settings & Support (P1):** Basic app settings, FAQ/Help section, feedback mechanism (PRD REQ-SET-001 to REQ-SET-003).
    *   **Application Tracking (Enhanced):** More detailed status updates (if Skyvern supports), near real-time updates (PRD REQ-TRACK-004).
    *   **Iterative UI/UX Improvements:** Based on user feedback from Phase 1.
*   **Primary Focus:** Improving user engagement, providing actionable insights, and stabilizing core features.

### Phase 3: Scaling, Advanced AI & Automation Deepening

*   **Goal:** Optimize the platform for a larger user base, introduce more sophisticated AI features for job matching and resume tailoring, and fully leverage Skyvern's capabilities.
*   **Key Deliverables (High-Level):
    *   **Full Skyvern Automation:** Maximize the reliability and coverage of automated applications across various job boards.
    *   **Advanced AI Features:**
        *   AI-powered resume tailoring for specific job descriptions (PRD Future Considerations).
        *   Personalized job recommendations beyond basic keyword matching.
    *   **Notification System:** Implement in-app and push notifications for application status updates, new relevant jobs, etc.
    *   **Performance Optimization:** Ensure backend and frontend can handle increased load (NFR-SCALE-001).
    *   **Security Enhancements:** Conduct security audits and implement recommendations (NFR-SEC-003).
    *   **Partnership Exploration:** Begin technical groundwork for potential integrations with job boards or HR tech companies (PRD Business Goals).
*   **Primary Focus:** Achieving high automation success, delivering significant AI-driven value, and ensuring platform robustness.

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion & Monetization

*   **Goal:** Expand Jobraker's reach through new platforms and languages, explore monetization strategies, and build a richer ecosystem around the core product.
*   **Key Deliverables (High-Level):
    *   **Multi-language Support:** Localize the app for key international markets (PRD Future Considerations).
    *   **Web-Based Version:** Develop a companion web application (PRD Future Considerations).
    *   **Premium Features / Subscription Model:** Investigate and implement monetization strategies (PRD Future Considerations).
    *   **Advanced Integrations:** Calendar integration for interviews, company research tools, etc. (PRD Future Considerations).
    *   **Community Features (Optional):** Forums, peer support, or other community-building elements.
    *   **Strategic Partnerships (Full Rollout):** Integrate with partner services.
*   **Primary Focus:** Growing the user base, establishing revenue streams, and creating a comprehensive job-seeking platform.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns (Applicable to all Phases)

*   **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date technical and user documentation.
*   **Testing (QA):** Rigorous testing (unit, integration, E2E, UAT) throughout each phase.
*   **CI/CD:** Implement and maintain continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging for proactive issue detection and resolution.
*   **Compliance:** Ongoing adherence to data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA - NFR-SEC-001).

## 5. Dependencies & Risks

*   **External APIs:** Continued reliance on Clerk, Adzuna, Skyvern, and Supabase. API changes, downtime, or limitations are key risks (PRD Section 9).
*   **Market Adoption:** User acquisition and retention are critical for success (PRD Section 9).
*   **Technical Complexity:** AI and automation features can be complex to implement and maintain reliably.
*   **Team Resources & Timeline:** Ensuring adequate resources and managing scope to meet timelines.

## 6. Review & Adaptation

This general implementation plan will be reviewed at the end of each phase. Learnings, user feedback, market changes, and new opportunities will be considered to adapt the plan for subsequent phases.
